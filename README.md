# wdtk-exemption-spotter
This is a proof of concept to show that spotting exemptions in WDTK requests and giving subsequent advice could be made to work relatively simply.

It's by no means complete: some more specific exemptions (like section 22a: [https://www.foiman.com/archives/1119]) probably won't be picked up properly at the moment. Also, the advice given should be a lot better. But it's just a proof of concept at the moment.

As this is not a properly packaged extension, in order to install and play around with it, follow the advice here: [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked]
